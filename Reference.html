<ul class="ng-scope"><li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book" target="_blank">Pro Git</a>. Here’s an entire open source book on learning and using Git. It looks like a long one, but I didn’t need to read anything past chapter three just to learn the basics.</li><li><a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git" target="_blank">Try Git</a>. CodeSchool and GitHub teamed up to make this speedy tutorial. If you want a little more practice with the basics, this should help. And if you have some extra money and want to learn everything there is to know about Git, Code School’s Git Real should do the trick.</li><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/GitHubGuides" target="_blank">GitHub Guides</a>. If you’re a visual learner, GitHub’s official YouTube channel is worth your time. I especially got a lot out of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo&amp;list=PLg7s6cbtAD165JTRsXh8ofwRw0PqUnkVH" target="_blank">Git Basics</a> four-part series.</li><li><a href="http://gitref.org/" target="_blank">Git Reference</a>. Got the basics down but find yourself always forgetting the commands? This handy site is great as a glossary reference</li><li><a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide" target="_blank">Git - the simple guide</a>. This tutorial is short and sweet, but it was a little too fast for me as a beginner. If you want to refresh on the basics of Git, this should be all you need.</li></ul>
